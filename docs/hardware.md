# Hardware check

`nybulah.hwcheck` runs every hardware step in one session so a single run
answers everything: per drive it identifies the model, probes for expansion
RAM (`nybulah.ramprobe`), benchmarks the monitor transport at the start of
the first unaliased RAM run (`nybulah.bench`, 8192 bytes, 2 repetitions)
and cross-checks the written pattern through M-R (alias check).

Each step is isolated: on any failure the host releases its IEC lines,
pulses RESET (twice if the drive stays silent) and waits for the drive's
status channel before moving on. Records stream as JSON lines to
`artifacts/hwcheck-<timestamp>.jsonl`; the last line is the summary.

## Build

```sh
docker build --target runtime -t nybulah .
mkdir -p artifacts
```

## S1, both drives powered

```sh
docker run --rm --device=/dev/bus/usb -v "$PWD/artifacts:/data/artifacts" nybulah hwcheck --devs 8 10
```

## S2, one drive powered

S2 strobes ATN, so every other drive must be switched off:

```sh
docker run --rm --device=/dev/bus/usb -v "$PWD/artifacts:/data/artifacts" nybulah hwcheck --devs 10 --s2
```

## S3 (X protocol), both drives powered

S3 needs xum1541 firmware v9 (flashed below) and the plugin this image builds
by default (`OPENCBM_SOURCE=git`). It uses only CLK/DATA, so other drives can
stay on; with older firmware or the stock plugin the step is recorded as
skipped:

```sh
docker run --rm --device=/dev/bus/usb -v "$PWD/artifacts:/data/artifacts" nybulah hwcheck --devs 8 10 --proto s3
```

The image's entrypoint is the `nybulah` command; `bench` and `ramprobe` are
its other subcommands (`nybulah <command> --help`), e.g.
`nybulah bench --dev 10 --protocol s3`.

## Flashing the ZoomFloppy firmware

The firmware hex is built from the same OpenCBM commit the image uses:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anarkiwi/OpenCBM && cd OpenCBM
git checkout 1617823447e3b4d663cb058dd74b0aa17d579703
docker build -f Dockerfile.nybulah --target firmware-hex -o fw .
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/fw:/fw" --entrypoint xum1541cfg nybulah info /fw/xum1541-ZOOMFLOPPY-v09.hex
```

`info` must print `model 2 version 9`. Then, with the ZoomFloppy plugged in
(drives may stay connected), flash it; the adapter re-enumerates as a DFU
bootloader during the update, so the container gets the whole USB tree:

```sh
docker run --rm --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb -v "$PWD/fw:/fw" \
  --entrypoint xum1541cfg nybulah update /fw/xum1541-ZOOMFLOPPY-v09.hex
docker run --rm --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb --entrypoint xum1541cfg nybulah devinfo
```

`devinfo` should report firmware version 9. If an update is interrupted the
adapter stays in its bootloader; run `update` again. Flashing the stock
`xum1541/xum1541-ZOOMFLOPPY-v08.hex` from the same tree the same way reverts it.

## Expected results

| device | model   | expansion RAM  |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| 8      | 1571    | `$6000-$7FFF`  |
| 10     | 1541-II | `$8000-$9FFF`  |

## Probe safety

Blocks that decode to I/O are never written:

- 1541: any address with A15=0 and A12 or A11 set (VIA1 `$1800`, VIA2
  `$1C00`, open bus and their mirrors).
- 1571: `$0800-$5FFF` (VIAs, WD1770 `$2000-$3FFF`, CIA `$4000-$5FFF`, and the
  undocumented decode below `$1800`).

Each probe writes a two-byte marker that never equals open-bus reads, then
restores every byte it changed, including base RAM reached through mirrors.

## Drive watchdog

The monitor runs VIA1 timer 1 free-running with its IRQ masked and polls the
flag only while a handshake spins. About one second without a completed byte
inside a command, or ten seconds waiting for the next command, makes the
drive release the bus, restore zero page `$30-$35` and VIA1 (ACR, IER, T1
latches) and return to DOS, as `Q` does. The host restarts the monitor
transparently when a command follows a longer pause. A 1571 running at 2 MHz
halves both windows; pass `idle_s=WATCHDOG_IDLE_S / 2 * 0.9` to `Monitor`
there.
